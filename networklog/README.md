#Android Network Log Monitor

_Requires rooted devices._



Network Log monitors iptables-logging to display a real-time list of which apps are making network connections, and provides statistics about those app connections.

##**Real-time log display**

The log tab shows the network packets being transmitted and their details such as:

  * source and destination addresses/ports
  * network protocol and interface
  * bytes transmitted
  * timestamp 

##**Real-time network usage statistics**

The applications tab lists installed applications along with network usage statistics such as:

  * total packets and bytes sent
  * active network throughput speed in Bps/Kbps/Mbps
  * timestamp of last connection
  * list of all the unique connections made by each app
  * sortable and filterable

##**Real-time connection notifications**

The statusbar icon's up/down arrows will highlight when upload/download traffic occurs, and the notification drop-down shade displays the connection throughput speed in Kbps.

You can also configure toast pop-up notifications on a per-app basis that will pop-up a temporary notification containing connection details no matter which app you are in.
